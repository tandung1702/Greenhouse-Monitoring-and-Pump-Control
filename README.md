# Greenhouse-Monitoring-and-Pump-Control
# Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a real-time embedded system that utilizes the LPC1768 microcontroller to monitor and control essential greenhouse parameters. Upon successful completion, students will:

Understand and apply GPIO, ADC, Timers, and SPI modules in an embedded application.
Implement multi-task programming using the RTX-RTOS.
Develop a user interface for interacting with environmental parameters.
Integrate sensor inputs and actuator control to create an automated greenhouse management system.

# GLCD and Joystick
Use SPI interface for GLCD communication.
Initialize joystick inputs for navigation.
Design GUI for displaying system status and menu navigation
